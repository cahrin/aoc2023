These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2022) done in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

In general, the solutions are focused on being testable and readable. 
In addition, an effort is made to find solutions that work for both parts 1 and 2, which often means refactoring part 1.
